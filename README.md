# Projects
A collection of projects developed throughout my academic and professional journey at the intersection of Machine Learning, AI, and Bioinformatics, with a focus on interpretable models for omics data and applications in healthcare. My work spans from building algorithms to uncover gene mechanisms related to aging (using scRNA-seq data) to designing novel tools that combine community detection, statistical methods, and LLM-powered analysis for personalized medicine.
The repository includes:
* Research, study and analysis of main scRNA-seq projects and data. 
* Interpretable ML models for omics data (scRNA-seq, proteomics, multi-omics integration)
* LLM-based frameworks for biological data interpretability and NLP in biomedical contexts
* Projects in healthcare NLP and data-driven dashboards providing actionable insights
* Cybersecurity-inspired approaches to ensure robustness and reliability in biomedical AI pipelines
  
Particullary,

* 1.State_of_art_scRNAseq contains the study of the main studies in scRNA-seq data with the objective of analyse them and find the best pipeline.
* 2.Analysis_ML_scRNAseq contains the analysis of "Chemical-induced epigenome resetting for regeneration program activation in human cells. Wang et al., 2023, Cell Reports 42, 112547 June 27, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112547", the implementation of their pipeline, and new proposed pipelines which handle the data preprocessing, batch effect... and new ML/AI models based on PCA, clustering and community detection, in Python and using other tools as Liger. The conclusions and results are in the pptx.
* 3.LLMs_scRNAseq contains experiments in scRNA-seq data using LLMs, from fine-tuning and inference to different approaches to get insights about the data.
* 4.KGs_CGs_scRNAseq contains experiments using KGs and CGs to discover mechanisms in scRNA-seq dataset, with the objetive of mix them with LLMs.
* 5.UMAP_implementation contains a scratch version of UMAP in MATLAB language.
* 6.NLP contains ML and deep learning projects to analyse patient data and help the doctors in the decision-making process.
