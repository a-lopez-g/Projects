# Projects
A collection of projects developed throughout my academic and professional journey at the intersection of Machine Learning, AI, and Bioinformatics, with a focus on interpretable models for omics data and applications in healthcare. My work spans from building algorithms to uncover gene mechanisms related to aging (using scRNA-seq data) to designing novel tools that combine community detection, statistical methods, and LLM-powered analysis for personalized medicine.
The repository includes:
* Research, study and analysis of main scRNA-seq projects and data. 
* Interpretable ML models for omics data (scRNA-seq, proteomics, multi-omics integration)
* LLM-based frameworks for biological data interpretability and NLP in biomedical contexts
* Projects in healthcare NLP and data-driven dashboards providing actionable insights
* Cybersecurity-inspired approaches to ensure robustness and reliability in biomedical AI pipelines
